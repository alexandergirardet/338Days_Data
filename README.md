# 338Days_Data
This is my 338 day learning journey in AI, Maths, and Data Engineering.

## Motivation
Growing up with ADHD, I found it difficult to excel in school despite being able to maintain slightly above average grades. However, being freed from the constraints of formal education allowed me to explore my own learning style and interests. During the first COVID-19 lockdown, I discovered my passion for coding and used my time in my Bangkok apartment to dive deeper into this field. I am now excited to undertake the 338 day data challenge as an opportunity to continue to grow and improve my skills in a field that I am passionate about. This challenge is a personal milestone that I am looking forward to achieving through determination and hard work.
